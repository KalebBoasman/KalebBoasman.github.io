		<h3>Review Questions</h3>

		<div>
			<!--ordered list made sense as the parent element to order the questions.-->
			<ol>
				<li>
					What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the
					experience?
					<!--
						I nested a division inside each list element to seperate the question
						and answer without creating unnecessary spacing and also so i could reference the div
						in the CSS sheet.
					-->
					<div>
						Two bright screens, one with a neon orange face and one with the
						instructions "click to begin" though I wasn't sure what this was referring
						to at the start.
					</div>
				</li>

				<li>
					Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your
					discrete actions.
					<div>
						<!--
							nesting an unordered list here made the list of discrete actions clearer.
						-->
						<ul>
							<li>Pressing the sound on button.</li>
							<li>
								Moved a slider up that supposedly "changed settings" according to one of
								the screens.
							</li>
							<li>
								Played around with a hexagonal button grid Realised it was a simon says
								game and completed it.
							</li>
							<li>
								Updated settings slider from earlier (that was actually a difficulty
								slider) to max
							</li>
							<li>Completed simon says game again</li>
							<li>
								Pressed on a button saying playmint that took me to the creators website
							</li>
							<li>Clicked on a screen displaying what appears to be a game.</li>
							<li>It changed the view on the screen to a new area.</li>
							<li>
								Changed difficulty parameters and completed simon says for each
								difficulty
							</li>
							<li>
								Attempted to enter code into new console that appeared after last action
								but no result.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
				</li>

				<li>
					What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?
					<div>
						A little bot displayed on a screen called Morton that hosted the Simon
						Says game on the website. I spent the majority of my time completing the 5
						difficulties of the Simon Says game as the rest of the site has rather
						minimal interaction that doesnt remove you from the site.
					</div>
				</li>

				<li>
					What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the
					experience?
					<div>
						My most common action was pressing the icon buttons for Simon Says though
						the difficulty slider was also a fairly common interaction. For a user
						returning to the site i believe the stat readout would be the most common
						interaction.
					</div>
				</li>

				<li>
					What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive
					experience?
					<div>
						I believe the primary goal is to advertise a game project called
						Downstream. It does this through inspiring curiosity and play with the fun
						and bright interface and the simon says game. Most links around the site
						take users to further information about the game or social links to
						connect with the creators and other users.
					</div>
				</li>

				<li>
					How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?
					<div>
						The right half of the screen displays a large box to sign up to a waiting
						list with an email, a small screen that displays whether a playtest is
						currently active, a receipt printer showing stats about the most recent
						playtest and a screen displaying the current state of the game that can be
						cycled through areas.
					</div>
				</li>

				<li>
					What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with
					over time?
					<div>
						There are plenty of social links and ways to connect with the experience
						that removes you from this particular website. This design intends to
						carry the user away to find out more and connect through other apps and
						websites once their curiosity has been piqued by the unique interface. For
						most users it would only be interacted with once though the live preview
						of the Downstream game itself suggests the site could be used to check
						occassionally check up on the game. Its meant to be moved on from quickly
						and not intended for long term engagement.
					</div>
				</li>

				<li>
					How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be interacted
					with over time?
					<div>
						The website primarily encourages users to return through its live stat
						feed and live video feed of the Downstream game. While this is minimal and
						users likely wouldnt stay for long it does provide a reason to return if a
						user is curious about the games growth. Besides this there is a hidden
						code entry after you complete all 5 difficulties of the Simon says game. I
						was unable to figure out its purpose but naturally this would require a
						user to return and play through the Simon Says game again should they ever
						acquire a code for the entry box.
					</div>
				</li>

				<li>
					What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience
					reference?
					<div>
						The site references somewhat of a command/control interface that youd see
						in a sci-fi ship game. The large power button, AI display panel and large
						hexagonal buttons all push this idea of a control panel and the three
						screens in the experience all have a grainy overlay and even glitch in
						some cases. This is purely an aesthetic choice to immerse the user into
						the panel. The loud humming and machine noises in the background also
						suggest that there is much more behind and around this panel that you cant
						see.
					</div>
				</li>

				<li>
					What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should act when
					engaging with your research experience?
					<div>
						Such a playful and futuristic control panel suggests that i should be
						largely curious and look for enjoyment with the experience. The lack of
						explanations on what parts of the panel do supports this as well as the
						idea that i should be thorough in my investigations of how it works and
						potential cross interaction in the same way you'd explore the controls and
						mechanisms of a game.
					</div>
				</li>

				<li>
					What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should feel
					when engaging with your research experience?
					<div>
						The futuristic panels definitely encourage the curiosity and childlike joy
						of interacting with a bright interface reminiscent of what youd see in a
						sci-fi game. It is meant to be exciting and make you want to dive further
						in to figure out its secrets.
					</div>
				</li>

				<li>
					What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and what makes
					that part frustrating?
					<div>
						The most frustrating part was being unable to interact with the Downstream
						game itself and the display screen doing no more than preview the map.
						This was explained by a small screen next to it informing me that there
						wasnt currently a playtest ongoing but it was frustrating having my
						curiosity piqued only to find out that the game itself is inaccessible for
						the forseeable future.
					</div>
				</li>

				<li>
					What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to you and what makes
					that part satisfying?
					<div>
						The most satisfying part of the interaction is the Simon Says game as the
						sounds included in it and the feedback of the buttons is designed to be
						satisfying and illicit a dopamine response. The way the difficulties tick
						off and you're rewarded with a code panel at the end also made me feel
						like my efforts had revealed a secret just for me and I was largely
						invested by that point.
