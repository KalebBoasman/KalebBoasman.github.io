	USER EXPERIENCE DESIGN ASSIGNMENT 2 - MEDIA PLAYER
	Kaleb Boasman s4006038

	I chose the music album direction and followed through by using the music album assets but
	decided to call it an "audio player" rather than a "music player" or "media player".
	This seemed fitting since the sounds weren't any sort of cohesive album and multiple were simply soundscapes rather than music.
	I do hope this still fits the brief as I attempted to include as many UI features and functions as I could
	with the limited resources and it is still perfectly viable as a music album player.

			a music album player.)
