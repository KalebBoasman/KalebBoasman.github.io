Assignment 3 - Kaleb Boasman - s4006308  
Navigation feature -> Click

After researching how difficult it would be to create a draggable map I quickly
abandoned the idea as it required the use of libraries or highly complex code that
i didn't have the confidence to navigate. Instead I elaborated on my other navigation
idea of a collapsible sidebar that now included a sticky navbar. The navbar would
move between main pages and the sidebar would be to navigate the current page. These two
combined will work well to handle the large amounts of content involed in the World of Palea
project. As of this moment the pages are mainly placeholders for the sake of demonstrating
functionality but the pages will be quite long in the future.

				<h3 id="1">World Summary</h3>
				<p>
					The world of Palea is undergoing a rapture. Half a century ago the Great
					Nations of the world sent their men off to die in the blistering deserts of
					the Divide, the blood of millions mixing with the currents of black gold
					running beneath the sands. Now the dust has settled and the people of Palea
					look inwards. It is an era of humanism, political theory, decolonisation
					and revolution. The actions of brave individuals, determined resistance
					movements and secret organisations will shape this era, not nations. To add
					to the cacophony of chaos engulfing Palea, a small population of gifted men
					and women are beginning to discover their hidden abilities - whether they
					use their newfound powers for good or evil remains to be seen.
